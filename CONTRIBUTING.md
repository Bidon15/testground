# Contributing guidelines

Testground as a project and community follows the [standard IPFS Community contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), extrapolated to Testground.

We appreciate your time and attention for going over these. Please open an issue on [ipfs/community](https://github.com/ipfs/community) if you have any question.

## Contributing Code

If you plan to contribute code, make sure to install the [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) tool, which manages our pre-commit hooks for things like linters, go fmt, go vet, etc.

We provide a `Makefile` rule to facilitate the setup:

```sh
$ make pre-commit
```
