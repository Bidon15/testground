# minimal viable test pipeline (MVTP) for IPFS

⚠️ **Heavy WIP.** ⚠️

This repository is incubating the test pipeline for IPFS. On its first
iteration, we're focusing on _continuous canary testing against the live
network_.

This repo will eventually evolve to contain the entire testing infrastructure
code for IPFS, in a form that is packagable and replicatable in other
environments, to enable downstream users to volunteer and participate in IPFS
release testing.

## MVTP architecture

_Subject to change._
