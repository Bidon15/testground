# canary testing coordinator service for IPFS

⚠️ **Heavy WIP.** ⚠️

This repository is incubating the _continuous canary testing service_ for IPFS. It will evolve to contain
a fully automated pipeline that subjects every commit, PR and release to continuous canary testing against
the IPFS public network, according to a master test plan.

## Target architecture

_Subject to change._
